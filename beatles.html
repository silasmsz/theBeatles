        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960.
            The group, whose best-known line-up comprised John Lennon, Paul McCartney,
           George Harrison and Ringo Starr, are regarded as the most influential
           band of all time. They were integral to the development of 1960s
           counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form.
           Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, their sound incorporated 
           elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways;
           the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian
           music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, 
           songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects
           of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth 
           and sociocultural movements

        <h2>Today</h2>
        <p>
            There’s no doubt about it – the Beatles are the most influential rock and roll band 
            of all time. Their catchy beats, thoughtful lyrics, and decade-appropriate fashion 
            made them superstars during their time, and time hasn’t dimmed their power.
            Not every member of the band is still around to enjoy the legacy of the Beatles,
            but fortunately, fans can still look to several of the famous bandmates in times of trouble.
            Read on to discover which members of the Beatles are still alive,
            and which ones have sadly passed on.        
        </p><br>

        <h3>John Lennon</h3>
        <p>John Lennon was arguably the most popular Beatle while he was alive. His anti-establishment 
            attitude and quiet defiance of war and discord made him a cultural icon, even after the
            band broke up in 1970. After the breakup of the Beatles, Lennon and his wife, fellow
            musician and artist Yoko Ono, worked together on projects that they believed would help
            to foster peace around the world. Not everyone appreciated Lennon’s message of solidarity,
            and he had many detractors. He received a lot of criticism during the last few years 
            of his life for his anti-war sentiments, but ultimately, he was gunned down in the 
            most violent way possible.      
            In 1980, John Lennon was shot by a man named Mark David Chapman, a man who waited 
            outside of his apartment, shooting Lennon after getting his autograph. Chapman 
            later admitted that he killed Lennon purely for attention and actually had “no 
            ill will” towards Lennon.            
            Although Lennon died as a result of his wounds, his message of peace and love 
            lives on, inspiring the generations of both musicians and fans that have followed
            in his inimitable footsteps.</p><br>
          <h3>George Harrison</h3>
          <p>
            When he was in the Beatles, George Harrison was known as the quiet one. Introspective
            and thoughtful as compared to his bandmate’s loud personalities, Harrison was responsible
             for penning many of the Beatles’ successful tunes and was widely credited with introducing
              Middle Eastern influence into their melodies.
            Following the band’s breakup, Harrison became a successful solo artist — his hit song 
            “My Sweet Lord” became his trademark ballad and it remains very popular to this day.            
            Sadly, Harrison fought a long battle with cancer while he was only in his fifties. 
            Ultimately, he passed away in 2001 from lung cancer at the age of 58.
          </p><br>
          <h3>Two Beatles are alive</h3>
          <p>Although two of their friends have fallen, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, the other
             two members of the Beatles, have soldiered on throughout the years. McCartney’s 
             staggering success as a solo artist has made him one of the wealthiest musicians in 
             the world, and although his rocky personal life has often made him the subject of 
             tabloid speculation, McCartney remains a force to be reckoned with. 
             As for Ringo Starr, the Beatles’ charismatic drummer, he has remained active and healthy
             well into his late 70s. He has consistently written and performed ever since the 
             breakup of the Beatles and has even earned renown as a painter. Starr has also continued 
             to collaborate with his former bandmate Paul McCartney, with McCartney making several 
             appearances on Starr’s 2017 album, “Give More Love.”
             Starr has an impressive net worth of around $150 million and still tours the world,
             playing music for sold-out crowds everywhere.             
             Fans love seeing Starr and McCartney and reliving the glory days of Beatlemania.
             Although not every member of the band got to live a long and happy life, fans can 
             take comfort in knowing that the songs of John Lennon and George Harrison will live on forever.</p>
